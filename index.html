        <h1>Can LGBT seniors afford to live in Ingersoll Senior Residences?</h1>

        <p>The Ingersoll Senior Residences is a 17-story affordable housing building that developers propose as “NYC's first senior living environment that promotes diversity and safety for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) elders, their friends and allies.” An estimated 100,000 LGBT elders currently live in the city, and they often face discrimination and living situations that become financially unsustainable. The complex is planned for Fort Greene, a neighborhood has an inflated cost of living. Ingersoll was awarded Section 8 Housing, “ensuring that apartments are affordable to anyone earning below 60% Average Median income.” Find out if you qualify to live in the housing and compare basic groceries staples to the closest supermarket.</p>
