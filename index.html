          <p> George Phipps is estranged from the family he says do not know he is gay and living with HIV. But, as an aging member of the New York City population,
            he has found comfort living in a building where there are others like him, with the medical services he needs to enjoy the latter years of his life. </p>
            <p> "(My family) thinks I am dead...I came out in my 50s in here. It took me that long to come out. It was one of my best friends here
              who helped me come out. Cause he'd been through the same thing I'd been through. I'm thinking, growing up, nobody had ever been through it.
              'Cause I had never been around nobody who had been through that."” said the 58-year-old Phipps, a resident at the Keith D. Cylar House Residence & Health Center, a service of Housing Works.

              Founded in 1990, Housing Works is a New York City nonprofit that provides housing for people living with HIV. </p>
            <p> He is now in search of a comfortable place he can call his permanent home. </p>

            <p>A recent report by AARP, the nation’s largest nonprofit dedicated to healthy livelihoods for the elderly in the United States —
              found that as many as 91 percent of LGBT seniors nationwide are interested in LGBT-friendly housing developments with in-house support
              and social services for older adults. </p>

            <p>  In New York City, No LGBT senior specific residence exists. </p>

            <p> Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders (SAGE) has partnered with the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) to fix that, by building two LGBT-friendly developments,
              the Crotona Senior Residences in the Bronx and Ingersoll Senior Residences in Brooklyn.</p>

              <p>As the city’s population continues to age, those who identify as LGBT among the aging are interested in housing that features
                on-site health services, and like Phipps, care for those living with HIV. </p>

                <blockquote>
                        <p>"My blood family won't deal with me cause I was doing drugs.
                          My new family? I know they're gonna be there for me. I love to have family. I like to have people around me." </p>

<p> In order to qualify for the Brooklyn development, residents must make 60 percent or less than the area median income (AMI). For Crotona in the Bronx, 50 percent or less of the
  AMI will help determine eligibility. </p>

<p> Construction will begin after a groundbreaking ceremony on the site of the Crotona development on May 17 in honor of International Day Against Homophobia.</p>
